# 🧠 LLMs From Scratch — My Personal Deep Dive

This repository is my **learning lab for building, training, and understanding large language models (LLMs)** from the ground up.  
Everything here is coded manually — no shortcuts, no black boxes — to deeply understand how transformers, tokenizers, optimizers, and distributed training truly work.

## 📖 Overview

I’m implementing and experimenting with different LLM architectures, attention mechanisms, and modern model designs that keep appearing in research and open-source projects. The goal is simple — to understand how these models actually work by building them myself, one at a time.
